#?Conditionals
By default, statements in Python script are executed sequentially from top to bottom. 
If the processing logic require so, the sequential flow of execution can be altered in two way:

    Conditional execution: a block of one or more statements will be executed if a certain expression is true
    Repetitive execution: a block of one or more statements will be repetitively executed as 
    long as a certain expression is true. In this section, we will cover if, else, elif statements. 
    The comparison and logical operators we learned in previous sections will be useful here.

#?If Condition
In python and other programming languages the key word if is used to check if a condition is true and to execute 
the block code. Remember the indentation after the colon.

#!Example
a = 3
if a > 0:
    print('A is a positive number')
# A is a positive number

As you can see in the example above, 3 is greater than 0. The condition was true and the block code was executed. 
However, if the condition is false, we do not see the result. In order to see the result of the falsy condition, 
we should have another block, which is going to be else.

#?If Else
If condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will run.

#!Example
a = 3
if a < 0:
    print('A is a negative number')
else:
    print('A is a positive number')

The condition above proves false, therefore the else block was executed. How about if our condition is more than two? We could use _ elif_.

#?If Elif Else
In our daily life, we make decisions on daily basis. We make decisions not by checking one or two conditions 
but multiple conditions. As similar to life, programming is also full of conditions. We use elif when we have 
multiple conditions.

#!Example
a = 0
if a > 0:
    print('A is a positive number')
elif a < 0:
    print('A is a negative number')
else:
    print('A is zero')

#?Short Hand
#! syntax
code if condition else code

a = 3
print('A is positive') if a > 0 else print('A is negative') # first condition met, 'A is positive' will be printed

#?Nested Conditions
Conditions can be nested

#!Example
a = 0
if a > 0:
    if a % 2 == 0:
        print('A is a positive and even integer')
    else:
        print('A is a positive number')
elif a == 0:
    print('A is zero')
else:
    print('A is a negative number')

-> We can avoid writing nested condition by using logical operator and.

#?If Condition and Logical Operators
#!Example
a = 0
if a > 0 and a % 2 == 0:
        print('A is an even and positive integer')
elif a > 0 and a % 2 !=  0:
    print('A is a positive integer')
elif a == 0:
    print('A is zero')
else:
    print('A is negative')

#?If and Or Logical Operators
#!Example
user = 'James'
access_level = 3
if user == 'admin' or access_level >= 4:
        print('Access granted!')
else:
    print('Access denied!')
